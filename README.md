# Omnibox Timer

A Chrome extension to set timers from the omnibox. It is good for
Keyboard lovers. Type 'tm' and space, then you can set the timer from
the omnibox. When time is over, Chrome will show a desktop
notification and tell you a message you entered. The default message
is 'Timer done!'.

## Install
Please visit [chrome web store][4].

## Examples
* `10 Lunch` : the default unit is minute. This timer will ring in 10 minutes.
* `30s` : 30 seconds
* `20m Go home` : 20 minutes
* `1h meeting` : 1 hour

## Media files
I used the icons from [this page][2] introduced in [this
article][1]. The alarm bell is downloaded from [this page][3].
